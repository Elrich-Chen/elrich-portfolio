I'm a developer studying CS at the University of Waterloo. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and have worked at clubs as well as undertaken freelance projects. I also have experience in community program leadership, having worked at UofT's engineering camps previously.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in positions to connect and strengthen the developer community like clubs, volunteer teaching positions or the rock climbing gym where all coders live :)
