summary: Practiced tactics; aiming for 1400 rapid.

TLDR: I picked up chess to sharpen how I think, not just how I play. It’s been humbling, addicting, and surprisingly meditative. I’m still a beginner — aiming for 1400 rapid — but it’s teaching me patience, pattern recognition, and how to think three moves ahead in both games and life.

I didn’t get into chess because I wanted to be good at it — I got into it because I needed something that made me think again. Something quiet, deliberate, and detached from constant noise. A space where progress doesn’t depend on luck, likes, or algorithms — just discipline and clarity. Chess became that escape.

I started training through daily tactics and 10-minute rapid games. The first few days were chaos — blunders, tilted losses, and ego checks. But over time, patterns began to emerge. I started seeing shapes on the board before they happened, anticipating traps, and — most importantly — understanding why I lost. My goal now is simple: reach 1400 rapid while actually learning the logic behind my moves, not just copying openings.

What I love about chess is how it rewires your brain to slow down. It’s become my mental reset after long coding sessions or information overload — pure strategic flow.

For anyone deep in brain rot or feeling mentally scattered, chess is an antidote disguised as a hobby. Start with puzzles, play short games, and learn from creators like GothamChess or Daniel Naroditsky. It’s not about winning — it’s about thinking differently. Every move you calculate replaces one more impulse to scroll.
